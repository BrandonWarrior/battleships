Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 14, 2024**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!


# Battleships! - Project 3

The Battleship Game is a Python-based console game where the player competes against the computer. Each player has a grid where ships are placed randomly. The goal of the game is to guess the locations of the opponent's ships and sink them before your ships are sunk.

## Features

- Home Screen: The game features an interactive home screen with options to start the game or view detailed instructions on how to play. It also includes input validation to ensure that only the correct options are selected.

- Player vs. Computer Gameplay: Players compete against a computer opponent, taking turns to guess the location of each other's ships. The game keeps track of both the player's and computer's moves, providing a challenging experience.

- Random Ship Placement: Ships are randomly placed on both the player's and computer's grids at the start of the game, ensuring a unique game experience each time. The placement logic prevents any overlap between ships.

- Real-time Feedback: During gameplay, hits ("H"), misses ("M"), and the status of the ships are displayed in real-time on the grid. This provides clear and immediate feedback to the player about their progress.

### Input Validation:

- Home Screen: Input validation ensures that players can only select valid options (1 or 2) when choosing to start the game or view instructions.

- Player Name: Players must enter a valid name to start the game, ensuring they cannot proceed without providing an appropriate input.

- Coordinate Input: The game validates that players input single-digit row and column values within the grid's range, preventing invalid entries during their turns.

- End Game Menu: Once the game concludes (whether the player wins or loses), an end-game menu is displayed, offering options to either restart the game or return to the home screen. Input validation ensures that players make a valid selection at this stage.

## Game Rules 

- The player and the computer take turns guessing the location of each other's ships.

- The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships before your own fleet is destroyed.

- Ships are placed randomly on the grid.

- Players are prompted to input row and column values to guess where the opponent's ships are.

- Hits will be marked as "H", misses as "M", and unexplored spots as "O".

## How to Play

- Upon launching, the player is presented with a home screen where they can either start the game or view instructions on how to play.

- After selecting the "Start Game" option, the player is asked to enter their name, and the game begins.

- The player takes turns guessing the location of the computer's ships by entering row and column coordinates, and the computer does the same for the player's grid.

- The game continues until one side sinks all the ships.


## Example Gameplay

### Home Page 

![home page](docs/images/home.png)

- The home page of the Battleships game displays a welcome message and ASCII art. The player is prompted to choose between two options: "1. Start Game" to begin playing or "2. Instructions" to learn how to play.

![invalid choice](docs/images/input-home.png)

- When a player enters an invalid input (anything other than "1" or "2") on the home screen, an error message appears, instructing them to enter either "1" to start the game or "2" to view the instructions.

### Instructions

![instructions](docs/images/instructions.png)

- The instructions screen provides detailed steps on how to play the Battleships game. It explains the goal, the game rules, and the player's objective. This screen is displayed when the player selects the "Instructions" option from the home page.

![instructions input validation](docs/images/instructions-validation.png)

- This screenshot shows the input validation feature on the instructions screen. If a player enters an incorrect key (anything other than "1"), an error message prompts them to enter "1" to return to the home screen, ensuring proper input validation and user guidance.

### Enter Name 
![enter name to start game](docs/images/enter-name.png)

- This screen prompts the player to enter their name before starting the game. It ensures that every player provides their name to personalize the game experience.


![invalid name](docs/images/invalid-name.png)

- This screen shows input validation when the player attempts to start the game without entering a valid name. An error message prompts the player to provide a name, ensuring they do not proceed with an empty or whitespace-only entry.

### Battleships Game 

![start of game](docs/images/start-of-game.png)

- This screenshot shows the beginning of the game after the player has entered their name. It displays the player's grid and provides details such as the grid size, the number of ships, and the ship type.

![duplicated turn](docs/images/duplicated-turn.png)

This screenshot demonstrates the input validation for repeated guesses. When the player tries to guess the same coordinates multiple times, an error message appears, instructing them to pick a new location.

![correct turn](docs/images/correct-turn.png)

- This screenshot shows that the player has entered valid coordinates correctly to play the game. However, the guess results in a "Miss," indicated by the "M" on the grid, showing that no ship was hit. If you manage to guess correctly it will be indicated by a "H" on the grid. You can also see the computers turn with a randomised guess each turn. 
Here is what you would see when you manage to guess correctly:
![hit](docs/images/hit.png)


![incorrect turn](docs/images/invalid-turn.png)

- This screenshot demonstrates the input validation feature in action. The player has entered invalid coordinates, and the game displays an error message, prompting them to enter valid coordinates within the grid's boundaries.

![loser](docs/images/loser-end.png)

- This screenshot appears when the player loses the game. The computer has sunk all the player's ships, and the game ends with a "Game over!" message.

![winner](docs/images/winner-end.png)

- This screenshot displays the end-of-game screen when the player wins. It congratulates the player for successfully sinking all the computer's ships and winning the game.

![input validation at the end of the game ](docs/images/end-game-validation.png)

- This screenshot demonstrates the input validation feature at the end of the game. If the player enters an invalid key when prompted to either restart the game or return to the home page, an error message appears, instructing them to enter "1" or "2" to make a valid choice.

### Testing Unhidden ships 

![computer unhidden ships](docs/images/unhide-ships.png)

- For testing purposes, this screenshot displays the computer's grid with ships unhidden. This feature helps verify ship placements during game development but is not part of the standard gameplay.

## Future Enhancements 

- Two-Player Mode: Add an option that allows two players, who are physically together, to play against each other on the same device. This mode will enable both players to take turns guessing each otherâ€™s ship positions, bringing more interactivity to the game.

- Customizable Number of Ships: Allow players to choose the number of ships before starting the game, adding more variety and control over the difficulty level.

- Different Ship Types: Implement different types of ships with varying sizes, which would make the game more strategic and challenging.

- Selectable Grid Sizes: Allow players to choose from different grid sizes, making the game adaptable to different levels of complexity.

## Code Structure 

- BattleshipGame: The main class responsible for managing the game.

- create_grid: Creates an empty game grid.

- place_ships: Randomly places ships on the grid.

- display_grid: Displays the current state of the grid.

- get_player_guess: Prompts the player for valid input.

- check_guess: Checks whether a guess is a hit or miss and updates the grid accordingly.

- computer_turn: Generates a random guess for the computer.

- start_game: Manages the game loop, alternating between player and computer turns.

- end_game_menu: Displays options to either restart the game or return to the home screen.

## Bugs and Fixes

- Invalid Input Handling: Resolved a bug where users could input multiple digits in the row/column inputs, which caused errors and unintended gameplay behavior. The input validation has been enhanced to ensure that only single-digit inputs are accepted, preventing out-of-bounds guesses and maintaining the integrity of the game. This fix ensures smoother gameplay and prevents players from entering invalid coordinates.

- Player's Grid Displayed Twice: Fixed the issue where the player's grid was displayed twice after each turn, which caused unnecessary clutter and confusion during gameplay. Now, the grid is displayed only once per turn, providing a clearer and more streamlined experience for the player, making it easier to track the progress of the game.

- Input Validation for Player Names: Fixed a bug where players could start the game without entering a name or by entering just whitespaces. The game now ensures that players provide a valid name by repeatedly prompting them until a non-empty, non-whitespace name is entered, enhancing the overall user experience and preventing unintended gameplay starts.

- Input Validation: Resolved an issue where the invalid input message on the home screen would not appear properly when entering an incorrect key. The problem was caused by the clear_console function, which was clearing the screen before the error message could be displayed. Now, the game properly displays the error message and waits for a valid input (1 or 2) before proceeding.
