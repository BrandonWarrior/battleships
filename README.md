Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 14, 2024**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!


# Battleships! - Project 3

The Battleship Game is a Python-based console game where the player competes against the computer. Each player has a grid where ships are placed randomly. The goal of the game is to guess the locations of the opponent's ships and sink them before your ships are sunk.

## Features

- Player vs. Computer: The player and computer take turns guessing the location of each other's ships.

- Random Ship Placement: Both player and computer ships are placed randomly on their respective grids.

- Guess Validation: The game ensures that the player's guesses are valid and within the grid boundaries.

- Feedback: Hits, misses, and sunk ships are displayed in real-time during the game.
